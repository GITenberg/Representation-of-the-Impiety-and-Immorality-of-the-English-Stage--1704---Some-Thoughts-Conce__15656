<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<p>
Within two or three years after the appearance in 1698 of Jeremy
Collier's <span class="title">A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English
Stage</span>, the bitter exchanges of reply and counter-reply to the charges
of gross licentiousness in the London theaters had subsided. The controversy,
however, was by no means ended, and around 1704 it flared again
in a resurgence of attacks upon the stage. Among the tracts opposing
the theaters was an anonymous pamphlet entitled <span class="title">A Representation of the
Impiety and Immorality of the English Stage</span>, a piece which was published
early in 1704 and which appeared in three editions before the end of that
year.
</p>

<p>
The author reveals within his tract some of the reasons for its appearance
at that time. He remarks upon the obvious failure of the opponents
of the theater to end "the outragious and insufferable Disorders
of the STAGE." He stresses the brazenness of the players in presenting,
soon after the devastating storm of the night of November 26-27, 1703,
two plays, <span class="title">Macbeth</span> and <span class="title">The Tempest</span>, "as if they design'd to Mock the Almighty
Power of God, <em>who alone commands the Winds and the Seas</em>." (<span class="title">Macbeth</span>
was acted at Drury Lane on Saturday, November 27, as the storm was subsiding,
but, because it was advertised in the <span class="title">Daily Courant</span> on Friday,
November 26, for the following evening, it would appear that, unless the
players possessed the even more formidable power of foreseeing the storm,
their presentation of <span class="title">Macbeth</span> at that time was pure coincidence. No performance
of <span class="title">The Tempest</span> in late November appears in the extant records,
but there was probably one at Lincoln's Inn Fields, which was not regularly
advertising its offerings.) The author also emphasizes the propriety,
before the approaching Fast Day of January 19, 1704, of noting once more
the Impiety of the stage and the desirability of either suppressing it
wholly or suspending its operations for a considerable period. Apparently
the author hoped to arouse in religious persons a renewed zeal for
closing the theaters, for the tract was distributed at the churches as
a means of giving it wider circulation among the populace. (<span class="title">The Critical

<a class="pb" title="2" name="page-intro-2" id="p004"></a>

Works of John Dennis</span> [Baltimore, 1939], I, 501, refers to a copy listed
in Magga catalogue. No. 563, Item 102, with a note: "19th Janry, Fast
Day. This Book was given me at ye Church dore, and was distributed at
most Churches.")
</p>

<p>
Except for the author's ingenuity in seizing upon the fortuitous
circumstances of the storm, the acting of <span class="title">Macbeth</span> and <span class="title">The Tempest</span>, and
the proclamation of the Fast Day (which was ordered partly because of
the ravages of the storm), there is nothing greatly original in the work.
The author was engaged, in fact, in bringing up to date some of the accusations
which earlier controversialists had made. For example, he reviews
the indictments of the players in 1699 and 1701 for uttering profane
remarks upon the stage, and he culls from several plays and prints
the licentious expressions which had resulted in the indictments. Like
Jeremy Collier before him and Arthur Bedford in <span class="title">The Evil and Danger of
Stage-Plays</span> later (1706), he adds similar expressions from plays recently
acted, as proof, presumably, of the failure of the theaters to reform
themselves in spite of the publicity previously given to their shortcomings.
In so doing, he damns the stage and plays by excerpts, usually
brief ones, containing objectionable phrases. To this material he adds
a section consisting of seventeen questions, a not uncommon device, addressed
to those who might frequent the playhouses. The questions again
stress the great difficulty involved in attending plays and remaining
truly good Christians.
</p>

<p>
The pamphlet must have been completed late in 1703 or very early
in 1704. The references to the storm and the performances of <span class="title">Macbeth</span>
and <span class="title">The Tempest</span> would place its final composition after late November,
1703, and it was in print in time to be distributed at the churches on
January 19 and also to be advertised in the <span class="title">Daily Courant</span> for January 20
under the heading "This present day is publish'd." The fact that it
quickly attained three editions during 1704 may be partially accounted
for by its being given to churchgoers, for it seems unlikely that the
pamphlet would have a tremendous sale, even if one allows for the strong
opposition to the stage which persisted in the minds of many people at

<a class="pb" title="3" name="page-intro-3" id="p005"></a>

the turn of the century. The author of the tract is unknown, although
Sister Rose Anthony in <span class="title">The Jeremy Collier Stage Controversy, 1698-1726</span>
(Milwaukee, 1937), pages 194-209, ascribed it to Jeremy Collier, an
attribution which E.&nbsp;N. Hooker, in a review of the book in <span class="title">Modern Language
Notes</span>, LIV (1939), 388, and also in <span class="title">The Critical Works of John
Dennis</span>, I, 501, has deemed unlikely.
</p>

<p>
Advertised also in the <span class="title">Daily Courant</span> for January 20, 1704, under
the heading "This present day is publish'd" and in the same paragraph
with the advertisement of <span class="title">A Representation</span>, was another short pamphlet,
<span class="title">Some Thoughts Concerning the Stage in a Letter to a Lady</span>. (Immediately
below this notice of publication was a re-advertisement of Jeremy Collier's
<span class="title">Dissuasive from the Play-House</span>, with the result that, on the day
following the Fast Day, three of the pamphlets attacking the stage and
referring to the performances of plays representing tempests soon after
the destructive storm of November 26-27, 1703, were brought simultaneously
to the attention of the public.)
</p>

<p>
It seems clear that the publication and distribution of these books
was a feature in the activities of the Societies for Reformation of Manners.
The anonymous <span class="title">Account of the Progress of the Reformation of Manners</span>
(13<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span> ed., 1705) boasted that the Societies had enlarged their design
by causing books to be written which aimed at "laying open to the
World the outragious Disorders and execrable Impieties of our most Scandalous
Play-Houses, with the fatal Effects of them to the Nation in general,
and the manifest Sin and Danger of particular Persons frequenting
of them" (p. 2). Defoe's <span class="title">Review</span> (III, no. 93, for August 3, 1706) pointed
out that thousands of Collier's books had been distributed at the
church doors by the Societies for Reformation of Manners and the founders
of the Charity Schools. Obviously the Societies did not restrict themselves
to the works of Collier. Incidentally, the habit of Collier and
his followers of giving excerpts to illustrate the profaneness and immorality
of the stage produced an unexpected effect in at least one quarter.
The same issue of the <span class="title">Review</span> tells us that the Rev. Dr. William
Lancaster, archdeacon of Middlesex, objected strongly to the dispersal

<a class="pb" title="4" name="page-intro-4" id="p006"></a>

of anti-stage tracts at the door of <em>his</em> church, on the grounds that
they tended "to teach the ignorant People to swear and curse."
</p>

<p>
<span class="title">Some Thoughts Concerning the Stage in a Letter to a Lady</span> was ascribed
by Halkett and Laing to Josiah Woodward, who was associated with
the Society for the Reformation of Manners, and the ascription has been
referred to by later writers on the controversy over the immorality of
the stage. According to Sister Rose Anthony (<span class="foreign">op. cit.</span>, pp. 203-209),
Jeremy Collier may have issued a pamphlet as a supplement to his <span class="title">Dissuasive
from the Play-House</span>, which was first published late in 1703; and
it has been conjectured (cf. <span class="title">Critical Works of John Dennis</span>, I, 501, 505)
that <span class="title">Some Thoughts</span> might be that work, especially since Dennis, at the
end of <span class="title">The Person of Quality's Answer to Mr. Collier's Letter</span>, refers
to a quotation from Tillotson which appears on pages 8-9 of <span class="title">Some Thoughts</span>
and begins his reference to the pamphlet by designating it as a "Letter
written by you [Collier], tho' without Name." In any event, both <span class="title">A Representation</span>
and <span class="title">Some Thoughts</span> stem from the renewed opposition to the
stage which arose in the winter of 1703-1704 and were activated in part
by the belief that the great storm of 1703 was a judgment brought on
England by, among other faults, the licentiousness of the stage.

<p>
The various Methods that have
been used for Preventing the outragious
and insufferable Disorders
of the STAGE, having been in a great
measure defeated: It is thought proper,
under our present Calamity, and before
the approaching FAST, to collect some
of the <em>Prophane and Immoral Expressions</em>
out of several late PLAYS, and to put
them together in a little Compass, that
the Nation may thereby be more convinced
of the <em>Impiety of the Stage</em>, the
Guilt of such as frequent it, and the Necessity
of putting a Stop thereto, either

<a class="pb" title="4" name="page-impiety-4" id="p009"></a>

by a total Suppression of the <em>Play-Houses</em>,
as was done in the Reign of Queen <em>Elizabeth</em>,
or by a Suspension for some considerable
time, after the Example of other Nations;
where, we are informed, the Stages
were very chaste, in respect of ours of this
Nation, who are of a Reformed Religion,
and do with so much Reason glory in
being of the best constituted Church in
the World; nay, 'tis out of doubt but the
<em>Theatres</em> even of <em>Greece</em> and <em>Rome</em> under
<em>Heathenism</em> were less obnoxious and offensive,
which yet by the Primitive Fathers
and General Councils stood condemned.
</p>

<p>
And is not the dangerous and expensive
War we are engaged in, together with
the present Posture of Affairs, a sufficient
Reason for this, tho' the Play-Houses were
less mischievous to the Nation than they
are?
</p>

<p>
Are we not also loudly called upon to
lay aside this prophane Diversion, by the
late dreadful Storm, terrible beyond that
which we are told was felt in the Year
1636? which, as a Right Reverend Prelate
has observ'd, some good Men then thought
presag'd further Calamity to this Nation,
and was accordingly followed by the Commotions

<a class="pb" title="5" name="page-impiety-5" id="p010"></a>

in <em>Scotland</em> the very next Year, and
not long after by the Civil War in <em>England</em>.
</p>

<p>
And if we go on to countenance such
open and flagrant Defiances of Almighty
God, have we not great Reason to fear
his heavy Judgments will consume us?
</p>

<p>
But further, Her Majesty having now,
upon Occasion of the late great Calamity,
appointed a Day of Solemn Fasting and
Humiliation throughout the Kingdom, for
the deprecating of God's Wrath, surely
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: Original has 'thePlayers'">the Players</ins> have little Reason to expect that
they shall still go on in their abominable
Outrages; who, 'tis to be observed with
Indignation, did, as we are assured, within
a few Days after we felt the late dreadful
Storm, entertain their Audience with
the ridiculous Representation of what had
fill'd us with so great Horror in their Plays
call'd <span class="title">Mackbeth</span> and the <span class="title">Tempest</span> as if they
design'd to Mock the Almighty Power of
God, <em>who alone commands the Winds and
the Seas, and they obey him</em>. No surely, it
cannot but be hoped, that a Suspension at
least of the Players acting for some considerable
time will follow, when the <em>Prophaneness
and Immorality of the Stage</em> comes
to Her Majesty's Knowledge, who, 'tis to

<a class="pb" title="6" name="page-impiety-6" id="p011"></a>

be remembred, has never once given any
Countenance to the Play-House by Her
Royal Presence, since Her happy Accession
to the Throne.
</p>

<p>
The abominable obscene Expressions
which so frequently occur in our Plays,
as if the principal Design of them was to
gratifie the lewd and vicious part of the
Audience, and to corrupt the virtuously
dispos'd, are in this black Collection wholly
omitted; lest thereby fresh Poison should
be administred instead of an Antidote.
</p>

<p>
<em>After the Endeavours used by Sir
<span class="name">Richard Blackmore</span>, Mr. <span class="name">Collier</span>,
and others, to Correct and Reform
the <em>Scandalous Disorders and
Abuses of the Stage</em> were found
too unsuccessful; in the Year <em>1699</em><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: Original has '.'">,</ins>
several of the <em>Players</em> were prosecuted
in the Court of <em>Common-Pleas</em>,
upon the Statute of <em>3 Jac. 1.</em> for
prophanely using the Name of GOD
upon the <em>Stage</em>, and Verdicts were
obtained against them.</em>
</p>

<a class="pb" title="7" name="page-impiety-7" id="p012"></a>

<p>

<p>
It must be again remembred, that the
detestable lewd Expressions contained in
the abovementioned Plays, which seem to
be the most pernicious part of our Comedies,
are not here recited, least they should
debauch the Minds and corrupt the Manners
of the Reader, and do the same Mischief,
in some degree, as they do in the
greatest when used upon the Stage, tho'
mentioned with never so great Indignation.
And it must be likewise taken notice of, that
these Instances of the prophane Language
of Plays, which the good Christian will
read with Horror, would not have been
put together, and laid before the World,
had not the Incorrigibleness of the Players
made it necessary for the Ends abovementioned.
</p>

<a class="pb" title="17" name="page-impiety-17" id="p022"></a>

<p>
<em>And now may not these plain Questions
be proposed, without Offence, to the
Persons who frequent our <em>Play-Houses</em>;
and especially to such of
them as appear at any times in our
Churches, and at the Holy Sacrament,
and be submitted to the Judgment
of all Mankind.</em>
</p>

<p>
I. Can Persons who frequent the <em>Play-Houses</em>,
and are not displeased to hear
Almighty God blasphemed, his Providence
questioned and denied, his Name
prophaned, his Attributes ascribed to sinful
Creatures, and even to Heathen Gods,
his Holy Word burlesqued, and treated as
a Fable, his Grace made a Jest of, his Ministers
despised, Conscience laught at, and
Religion ridiculed; in short, the Christian
Faith and Doctrine exposed, and the sincere
Practice of Religion represented as
the Effect of Vapours and Melancholy,
Virtue discountenanced, and Vice encouraged.
Evil treated as Good, and Good
as Evil, and all this highly aggravated by
being done in cool Blood, upon Choice
and Deliberation? Can those, I say, that

<a class="pb" title="18" name="page-impiety-18" id="p023"></a>

frequent the <em>Play-Houses</em>, and are not displeased
with any of these things, be
thought to have any due Sense of Religion?
</p>

<p>
II. Can Persons who often spend their
Time and Money to see Plays, be suppos'd
to be displeas'd with, and to have
a due Indignation at, the Hearing the
Outrages beforementioned, which so often
occur in them, and of which there is a
dismal Specimen laid before the World in
this Paper?
</p>

<p>
III. Can sincere Christians encourage and
assist, by their Presence and Purses, Men
in committing such Practices, and in their
living by a Profession, which, as it is managed,
is so inconsistent with Christianity?
</p>

<p>
IV. Can any who have a true Concern
for the Honour of Almighty God, give
Countenance and Support to such Entertainments
whereby he is so dishonour'd and
affronted, though they could suppose themselves
above the Danger of being the worse
for them, which they can never be?
</p>

<p>
V. Can Persons who know 'tis generally
allowed, that the Infidelity and

<a class="pb" title="19" name="page-impiety-19" id="p024"></a>

Looseness of the Age is very much owing
to the Play-Houses; who have observed,
that the Zeal of particular Persons have
decreased, and their Strictness of Life abated,
by their going to Plays; and do
think that the Gospel obliges them to
discourage, by their Reproof and Example,
Sin in their Neighbours, to endeavour,
according to their Advantages and Opportunities,
to further their spiritual Welfare,
and to be <em>Lights</em> to lead others in their
Duty and Way to Heaven? Can such, tho'
they could think themselves wholly secure
from taking Infection in going to the Play-House,
encourage others, even weak and
feeble Christians, by their Example, to run
to the same dangerous Place likewise? Can
this be thought an Expression of their Charity
to their Neighbour, or to be acceptable
to Almighty God? or rather, Should
not Compassion to the Souls of their
Neighbours keep such as have a due Concern
for them from going to such Places?
</p>

<p>
VI. Can it be denied, but that the
going of a few sober Persons, tho' but
once a Year, to see a Play, that they
think less offensive and dangerous, does
encourage many others to go frequently
to Plays, and to those that are more abominably

<a class="pb" title="20" name="page-impiety-20" id="p025"></a>

loose and prophane; who might
never go at all to them, if none frequented
them but such as were entirely abandoned
to Shame as well as Vice?
</p>

<p>
VII. Can Persons who have good Dispositions
to Religion, who go but once or
twice in a Year to the <em>Play-House</em>, say,
upon their Experience, that they think the
seeing of Plays is proper to encrease the
Love of God in Men, to fit them for holy
Exercises, and to promote their spiritual
Welfare? or rather, Must they not own,
that by the seeing of Plays they are more
indisposed for Religious Performances;
that the Awe and Reverence which they
had for God and Religion, and the Horrour
which they had at the Sins which they
there see Men divert themselves with, and
make a Jest of, does thereby wear off;
that their sensual Desires are more heightned
and enflamed; that they are more
alienated from God, and more enamoured
with the World?
</p>

<p>
VIII. Can Persons who are sensible of, and
do heartily lament their want of the Love
and Fear of God, their too great a Love
of the World, the frequent Distractions of
their Mind in Prayer, and the Unruliness of
their Lusts and Passions, delight to frequent

<a class="pb" title="21" name="page-impiety-21" id="p026"></a>

a Place where they are surrounded with
Temptations to the Love of the World;
where what can excite to unlawful Desires
and Actions is promoted; and the Arts of
an easie Defilement are studied? Can they
think this consistent with the Rules of
keeping from all Appearance of Evil, of
avoiding the Occasions and Temptations
to Sin, and that Watchfulness over their
Thoughts, and that Diligence in making
their Calling and Election sure, as the Gospel
requires? Do they in any wise herein
adorn their Profession, resemble the Christians
who lived in the first Ages of Christianity;
or those who in any Age since
have been celebrated for their Virtue?
</p>

<p>
IX. Can Persons in good earnest pray,
as they are directed in the Lord's-Prayer,
<em>Not to be led into Temptation</em>, and yet frequent
the Play-House, where they are assaulted
with more and greater Temptations
than incounter them perhaps in any
other Place?
</p>

<p>
X. Can such Persons as go to the <em>Play-Houses</em>
on Week-days, and appear in our
<em>Churches</em> on the Lord's-day, and even at
the Holy Sacrament, where they declare,
that they <em>present themselves, their Souls and

<a class="pb" title="22" name="page-impiety-22" id="p027"></a>

Bodies, as a reasonable, holy and lively Sacrifice
to God</em>, be suppos'd to attend upon
these Holy Ordinances with a suitable
Frame of Mind; since the Language and
Design of Sermons, and of our Liturgy,
and of Plays, are so different and even directly
contrary to each other?
</p>

<p>
XI. Can Ladies really dislike Lewd Discourse
in Conversation, and yet like to see
Lewdness represented in all the Dresses that
can vitiate the Imagination, and fasten upon
the Memory?
</p>

<p>
XII. Can Parents, or any other Persons
who have the Conduct of Youth, and
have any serious Concern for the Souls of
their Children, or of those that are committed
to their Care, satisfie their Consciences,
without Restraining them from
going to a place of such Impiety and Infection;
where they would be in the
way to unlearn the best Instructions of
their Parents and Governours; where
Pride and Falshood, Malice and Revenge,
Injustice and Immodesty, Contempt of
Marriage, and false Notions of Honour,
are recommended; where Men are taught
to call in question the first Principles of
their Religion, and are led to a contempt
of Sacred things?
</p>

<a class="pb" title="23" name="page-impiety-23" id="p028"></a>

<p>
XIII. Can sincere and judicious Christians
think that the Players exposing (as
they pretend to do) Formality, Humour,
and Pedantry, is an Equivalent for their
insulting sacred things, and their promoting
to so high a degree the Prophaneness
and Debauchery of the Nation?
</p>

<p>
XIV. Can modest and prudent Christians
think, that the Opinion of the General
Councils, Primitive Fathers, and so
many wise and good Men in the several
Ages of the Church, who have condemned
the going to Plays as unlawful,
and as a renouncing the Baptismal Engagements,
doth not deserve great regard?
</p>

<p>
XV. Can sincerely religious Persons
hear of the most horrid, licentious Treatment
of sacred things as is in our Plays,
and this not among <em>Mahometans</em> and <em>Infidels</em>,
not at <em>Rome</em> and <em>Venice</em>, but in a
Protestant Countrey, without a Fear that
the Judgments of God will fall upon us?
</p>

<p>
XVI. Can less be expected from good
Christians, who are sensible of the intolerable
Disorders of the Play-Houses, and
the Mischiefs that are brought upon Mankind

<a class="pb" title="24" name="page-impiety-24" id="p029"></a>

by them, than that they would use
all proper Methods for the Discouraging
and Restraining their Relations and Friends
from going to them, as they have any
Concern for the Honour of God, the Good
of Mankind, and the Welfare of their own
Immortal Souls; that so by Persons,
who have any virtuous Principles, keeping
from a Place which they will never
be able to frequent with Safety to themselves,
under any partial Regulation; the
<em>Players</em>, the unhappy, the miserable <em>Players</em>,
may be necessitated to quit their Profession,
and take upon them some honest
and useful Employment (wherein
good Men ought to encourage and assist
them) and thereby the execrable Impieties
of the <em>Play-Houses</em>, and the ruinous consequences
of them, be prevented?

XVII. Lastly, Can Persons frequent
the Play-Houses, after the outragious Impieties
of them, and the fatal Effects of
their going to them, are in so full and advantageous
a manner laid open to the
World, without a greater Aggravation of
their Guilt?

<p>
<em>Madam</em>,
</p>

<p>
It is with no little Pleasure I behold
you treading in the Paths of <em>Virtue</em>,
and practising the Duties of a Holy
and Religious life. This, as it has deservedly
gain'd you the Love and Admiration
of all that know you: so, I doubt
not, but you will always find it a <em>Fund</em> of
solid Peace and Satisfaction to your own
Mind. I heartily wish there were many
more such bright Examples in the World,
that the Ladies might be at last convinc'd,
<em>That there is something worthy their
Imitation beyond the Modes of Dress and
Equipage; something which will render
them much more agreeable to the best and
wisest of their Admirers, and, in time,
no less pleasing to themselves</em>. I make no
doubt but the Age (as corrupt as it is)
can furnish us with many Instances of
those of your <em>Sex</em>, who think the Beauty
of the Mind does far surpass the gay
Appearances of the most splendid Outside:
But yet, it must be confessed, that there

<a class="pb" title="4" name="page-thoughts-4" id="p032"></a>

are others, (and those not a few) whose
Lives are almost one continued Circle of
Vanity and Folly. Such as divide the best
and most precious part of their Time between
their <em>Toilet</em>, the <em>Exchange</em>, and the
<em>Play-House</em>. This, I believe, upon Enquiry,
will appear to be no unjust Censure; tho'
at the same time, <em>Madam</em>, I must freely
own to you, that I think it a most amazing
thing, that the <em>Ladies</em> (at least
those who make any Pretensions to Virtue
and Goodness) should ever be seen at
the last of these Places; where they find
themselves so scandalously treated. I am
apt to think, that very few of 'em have
read Mr. <span class="name">Collier</span>'s <span class="title">View of the Stage</span>; if
they had, they would there see the <em>Corruptions</em>
of the Plays set in so clear a Light,
that one would believe, they should never
after be Tempted to appear in a Place
where <em>Lewdness</em> and <em>Obscenity</em> (not to
mention other Immoralities) are so great
a part of the Entertainment; a Place that
is now become the <em>Common Rendezvouz</em> of
the most Lewd and Dissolute Persons;
the <em>Exchange</em>, (if I may so call it) where
they meet to carry on the <em>vilest</em> and <em>worst</em>
of Practices. 'Tis the Nursery of all manner
of <em>Wickedness</em>, where the Seeds of

<a class="pb" title="5" name="page-thoughts-5" id="p033"></a>

<em>Atheism</em> and <em>Irreligion</em> are sown, which
Weak and Tender Minds too readily cultivate,
and from thence are easily led into
a <em>Contempt</em> of all that's Serious. It is impossible
to say, how many, and how great
the <em>Mischiefs</em> are that spring from thence;
which if a Man should take a View of, it
would perhaps, be one of the most Melancholy
Prospects that ever he beheld. To
look into our <em>Modern Plays</em>, and there to see
the Differences of Good and Evil confounded,
Prophaneness, Irreligion, and
Unlawful Love, made the masterly Stroaks
of the <em>fine Gentleman</em>; Swearing, Cursing,
and Blaspheming, the Graces of his
Conversation; and Unchristian Revenge,
to consummate the Character of the <em>Hero</em>;
Sharpness and Poignancy of Wit exerted
with the greatest Vigor against the <em>Holy
Order</em>; in short, Religion and all that is
Sacred, Burlesqu'd and Ridicul'd; To see
this, I say, and withall, to reflect upon the
fatal Effects which these things have already
had, and how much worse are likely
to follow, if not timely prevented, cannot
but fill the Minds of all good Men
with very dismal Apprehensions.
</p>

<p>
And are these then the Entertainments

<a class="pb" title="6" name="page-thoughts-6" id="p034"></a>

for a Christian to be pleas'd with; for one
whose <em>Salvation</em> is to be wrought out with
Fear and Trembling? Will the Strictnesses
of Virtue and Religion be ever
relished by a Mind tinctur'd with such
Licentious Representations? Must not
such Diversions (to say no worse of 'em)
insensibly steal upon the <em>Affections</em>, especially
of the <em>Younger sort</em>; give their Minds
quite a wrong Biass, and disarm them of
that <em>Severity</em> which is their greatest Guard,
and which, when once lost, leaves 'em
an easie Prey to every Temptation? Will
not those <em>Lewd Scenes</em> of Love, wherewith
almost every Play is fraught, inflame
the Fancy, heighten the Imagination, and
render a Person thus prepar'd, a fit Subject
for ill designing People to work on? But
suppose it were possible to be so armed as to
be Proof against all these Dangers; yet
let any that have the least Regard to what
is <em>Serious</em>, tell me how they can answer
it to <em>God</em>, or their own <em>Consciences</em>, to be
any ways Instrumental towards the <em>Support</em>
of so much Wickedness? Do they think
it a Sin to give the least Encouragement
to Vice, and at the same time believe themselves
<em>Innocent</em>, when by their <em>Persons</em>, and
their <em>Purses</em>, they contribute to the cherishing

<a class="pb" title="7" name="page-thoughts-7" id="p035"></a>

the very <em>Seed-Plot</em> of Irreligion?
'Tis to no purpose for such to say, That they
are cautious what Plays they see, and always
go to the best and that the <em>Play-Houses</em>
would thrive whether they frequented
them or no. This may he true,
but what then, Will this excuse them?
Suppose a powerful <em>Rebellion</em> is begun in
a Nation, and carried on <em>successfully</em>, for some
time; and a Man should not only appear
sometimes among the Rebels, but should,
now and then, send them a <em>Supply</em> (tho'
never so little) of Money and Arms:
Could such a one pretend that he was
no ways <em>Instrumental</em> in this Rebellion,
nor Accessary to the Mischiefs that attended
it, and that because it was not
only <em>begun</em>, but would have <em>prosper'd</em> too,
without him; and altho' he did sometimes
appear among the Authors of it,
yet it was with the Party which did the
least Mischief? Do you think, <em>Madam</em>,
this a just way of Reasoning? I dare say
you do not. Is not this then the very
Case I am speaking of? Is the <em>Stage</em>, as
'tis now manag'd, any thing else but a
downright Rebellion against God and his
Holy Religion? Are not the Plays, (if
not by Design) yet by a natural and necessary

<a class="pb" title="8" name="page-thoughts-8" id="p036"></a>

Consequence, an <em>undermining</em> of
his Laws, and an <em>Attempt</em> upon his Government?
And must it not then follow,
that <em>every one</em> that <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: Original has 'freguents'">frequents</ins> them, is a <em>Party</em>
in the <em>Cause</em>, and <em>encourages</em> the Undertaking?
And tho' he should be so Happy as never
to smile at a <em>Prophane Jest</em>, nor join in
Applauding a <em>Vitious</em> Play; yet, will
that exempt him from a Share of that
<em>Guilt</em> which his Presence and Purse has
help'd to support? No, <em>Madam</em>, 'tis <em>Numbers</em>
strengthen the Enemy, and give
fresh Courage to his Attempts! A <em>Full</em>
House is the very <em>Life</em> of the Stage, and
keeps it in Countenance, whereas <em>thin
Audiences</em> would, in time, make it dwindle
to nothing.
</p>

<p>
I know, <em>Madam</em>, this is strange Doctrine
to some People. If a Man talks to them of
leaving the Plays, they wonder what he
means, and are ready to take him for
a Madman. They have so long habituated
themselves to the <em>Play-Houses</em>, that they
begin to think a <em>Place</em> there, to be part of
their <em>Birth-Right</em>: But I desire such would
be perswaded to hear what the late
A.&nbsp;B. <span class="name">Tillotson</span> thought of these matters,
(and I hope some Deference is due to his

<a class="pb" title="9" name="page-thoughts-9" id="p037"></a>

Judgment). If they look into the 11<i>th</i>
Volume of his <span class="title">Sermons</span>, they will find that
in his Discourse against the <em>Evil of Corrupt

Communication</em>, he tells them, <em>That Plays,
as the Stage now is, are intolerable, and not
fit to be permitted in a Civiliz'd, much less in
a Christian Nation, They do most notoriously
minister</em>, says he, <em>both to Infidelity
and Vice. By the Prophaneness of them
they are apt to instil bad Principles into the
Minds of Men, and to lessen that Awe, and
Reverence which all Men ought to have for
God and Religion: and by their Lewdness
they teach Vice, and art apt to infect the
Minds of Men, and dispose them to Lewd
and Dissolute Practices. And therefore</em>,
says he, <em>I do not see how any Person pretending
to Sobriety and Virtue, and especially
to the pure and holy Religion of our
Blessed Saviour; can, without great Guilt
and open Contradiction to his Holy Profession,
be present at such Lewd and Immodest
Plays, much less frequent them, as
too many do, who would yet take it very ill
to be shut out of the Communion of Christians,
as they would most certainly have been in
the first and purest Ages of Christianity.</em>
</p>

<a class="pb" title="10" name="page-thoughts-10" id="p038"></a>

<p>
This is the Opinion, <em>Madam</em>, of that
Excellent Man: and, one would think,
it should put those Persons who are the
Encouragers of Plays, and the Frequenters
of them, when they read it, upon an Enquiry,
What it is they are doing? Whether
they are not carrying on the Designs
of the great Enemy of Mankind? But
if that will not prevail upon them, let 'em
reflect upon the late Instance of God's <em>severe
Displeasure</em> against us, and tell me then,
whether they think it consistent with that
<em>Humiliation</em> and <em>Repentance</em> which this
great Judgment ought to awaken in us,
and which <em>Her Majesty</em>, by Her late Gracious
<em>Proclamation</em>, calls upon us to Exercise,
to be ever again present at a <em>Place</em>,
where they must often hear the Name of
<em>God</em> Prophaned, and every thing that is
<em>Serious</em> made a Jest of? A <em>Place</em> which
they cannot but know, and must own,
(if put to the Question) has contributed
so much to the <em>Corrupting</em> the present
Age; and which, 'tis to be fear'd,
is one of those <em>accursed things</em>, that has
provok'd the Almighty to be so angry
with us.
</p>

<a class="pb" title="11" name="page-thoughts-11" id="p039"></a>

<p>
These are things, <em>Madam</em>, of no trifling
Importance; they are such as deserve the
serious Reflections of all <em>good</em> Christians,
whatever the <em>Pretenders to Gaiety</em> may
think. And though some may, perhaps,
misconstrue and ridicule such Considerations
by the Names of <em>Preciseness</em> and
<em>Fanaticism</em>; yet, 'tis to be hop'd, that all
who have any regard for the <em>Honour</em> of
God, the <em>Welfare</em> of their Countrey, and
the <em>Interest</em> of our <em>Established Church</em>,
will not be laugh'd out of their <em>Duty</em>,
but be perswaded, not only to withdraw
<em>themselves</em> from a Place of so much Danger,
but advise <em>others</em> to do the like;
that the Stage may no longer Triumph
in the <em>Spoils</em> of Virtue and Religion. 'Tis
<ins class="unclear" title="Transcriber's Note: Original has last two letters blacked out">now</ins> the time to begin such an <em>Undertaking</em>:
We have a powerful Enemy
<em>abroad</em>, and a more formidable one at
<em>home</em>; I mean that <em>Looseness</em> and
<em>Irreligion</em> which so abounds: and what will
it avail us to <em>subdue</em> the one, while we
<em>encourage</em> the other? The <em>Hand of God</em>
has been lifted up against us, we have seen
the <em>Terrors of the Lord</em>, and felt the <em>Arrows
of the Almighty</em>; and what can all
this mean, but to awaken us to a due
Sense of our <em>Danger</em>? And, 'tis to be

<a class="pb" title="12" name="page-thoughts-12" id="p040"></a>

hop'd, the Nation has already taken the
Alarm, and begin to think how to avert
God's Displeasure. The <em>Stage</em> is called in
Question, and Papers are dispers'd to warn
us of its Mischiefs; and it is not improbable
that the <em>Licentious</em> and <em>Unbounded
Liberty</em> the Players have taken of late
years, and particularly in their daring to
Act <span style="letter-spacing: 0.5em;">THE TEMPEST</span> within a very
few Days after the late dreadful Storm,
has rais'd in the Minds of Men such an
Abhorrence and Indignation, that we may
possibly be so happy as to see the Stage
(if not <em>totally suppress'd</em>) yet brought
under such a <em>Regulation</em>, both as to the
<em>Plays</em> that are Acted, and the <em>Company</em>
that Resort to them, that Foreigners may
no longer <em>stand amaz'd</em> when brought <ins class="unclear" title="Transcriber's Note: Original has characters blacked out">into</ins>
our <em>Theatres</em>, nor Good Men <em>tremble</em>
at the Continuance of them: but that
<em>Virtue</em> may appear there with all its
Charms, and <em>Vice</em> be expos'd to the utmost
<em>Contempt</em>. In short, that the Stage
may become so <em>Chast</em>, that even those
<em>Birds of Prey</em> who now hover about the
<em>Play-Houses</em> and make the Avenues to
'em so dangerous, may fly away from a
Place that will no longer <em>Encourage</em> nor
<em>Protect</em> them.
</p>

<a class="pb" title="13" name="page-thoughts-13" id="p041"></a>

<p>
But after all, <em>Madam</em>, Whether this is
such a Scheme as can ever be reduc'd in
Practice; whether so <em>noble a Structure</em> as
I am speaking of, can be erected upon so
<em>rotten</em> a <em>Foundation</em>; whether the <em>Wound</em>
is not <em>Gangreen'd</em>, and must be cur'd by
<em>Excision</em>; I say, whether such a <em>Regulation</em>
of the <em>Stage</em> be possible, must be left to
those who have <em>Skill</em> and <em>Authority</em> to try
the Experiment. In the mean time, it will
be every one's Duty to run from a Place of
such <em>Infection</em>, least they contribute to the
spreading a <em>Disease</em> which may, in time,
prove <em>Fatal</em> to the whole Nation. But
I forget, <em>Madam</em>, I am intrenching upon
your Patience, while I detain you in a
place you have so long abandon'd. I am
fallen upon a Subject, which 'tis difficult
not to say much of: but I shall no longer
interrupt your better Thoughts, than while
I beg Pardon for this Trouble, who am,

Three editions were issued in 1704.  If we take
the author's words literally, the pamphlet was
written between the "Great Storm" of November 26,
1703 and the day of fasting decreed by Queen Anne
for January 19, 1704.  According to Arthur Bedford
(<span class="title">The Evil and Danger of Stage Plays</span> ... London,
1706) the pamphlet was published "At the Time of
the Fast ..."

six issues annually. As soon as the Society's membership increases
sufficiently to warrant it, we shall bring out additional

<h2>Future Plans</h2>

It has seemed desirable that for the Second Year we should continue
the present series (on Wit, on Poetry and Language, and

Rare Periodicals, or some such unifying topic or theme. Send us
your suggestions for items in these or in the present series.
All suggestions are listed in our files; and our policy in publications
will be determined by the requests of members.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
